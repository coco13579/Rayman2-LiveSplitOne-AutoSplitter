# TUNIC LiveSplit One AutoSplitter

TUNIC Livesplit One AutoSplitter with custom splits

# Description

This program allows TUNIC autosplitting on LiveSplit One Browser, which is CSS customisable unlike original LiveSplit.

I suggest using [LiveSplit One OBS Layout](https://github.com/jeanwll/LiveSplitOne-OBS-Layout) which was made alongside this project.

# Usage

1. Edit splits.txt
    - Each line is a split condition, either [a zone number or an event](https://github.com/just-ero/asl/blob/main/TUNIC/TUNIC.asl)
    - Order them accordingly to your splits order

2. Start AutoSplitter.exe

3. Interact OBS browser source
    - Select Compare Against: "Game Time"
    - Connect to server "ws://localhost" (should be in clipboard)
